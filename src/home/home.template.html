  <h2>About me</h2>
  <section>
    <p>Hi, My name is Kyrylo, but everyone calls me Kir.</p>
    <p>I started developing in 2016 and found it quite exciting! After I successully finnished my first HTML/CSS layouts I dived into Javascript - I wanted my web-pages to be interactive.</p>
    <p>Actually, I thought it would be great to be able to create a web-calculator, but soon it became clear to me that the calculator is a very simple task. Thus I dig further and luckily became a student at the Global Logic JS basecamp. The link to the information about the basecamp <a href="https://kirperepolov.github.io/GlobalBC/" target="_blank">is here</a> and is pinned at the bottom of the page.

     </p>
    <p>I decided to try myself in coding after I had worked as a technical coordinator for 5 years. I was responsible for launching IT products and I've got used to discover in details how systems work. Sometimes I even prepared chunks of code to spead up development and testing phases. Once I thought: "it attracts me, why shouldn't I spend more time doing such things?"</p>
    <p>During 2016 I gained knowledge and practical experience in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML5</li>
      <li>CSS3</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <p>...and some libraries and frameworks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>jQuery</li>
      <li>Bootstrap</li>
      <li>AngularJS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and after all I started my career as a software developer.</p>
    <p>Besides the described I have some experience in maintaining a commercial site built on WordPress by changing the Javascript and PHP code of some plugins (some kind of volunteering).</p>
